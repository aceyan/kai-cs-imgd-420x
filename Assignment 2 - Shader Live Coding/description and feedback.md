# Description
I am a huge fan of Initial D (a car racing animation). So, I picked one of the episodes named speedy speedy boy from this cartoon as the BGM of my assignment. This episode in the anime is accompanied by intense racing and drifting scenes. It manages to create a sense of adventure and speed in a car race, so much so that every time I hear the song I recall the image of two cars chasing each other down a mountain road at night. In my assignment project, I plan to convey the tension and excitement of car racing in our project.
Firstly, I used a sin curve in my scene, which is to simulate the winding road on the mountain. Also, I changed the shape of the curve and the color of the screen according to the rhythm of the music to make it cooler. I used discard command to clip some parts of the scene to create a feeling like driving on a highway at night. With the inspiration from some car racing games, I created the second stage on my scene. I added the radial blur effect which is a widely used post-processing to create a sense of speed, by using the backbuffer provided by the Force. And, I spun the UV and make the sample like a circle(somewhat). The center of the radial blur is following the position of the mouse.

# Feedback
I got some feedbacks from John.
1. This demo brings authentic Analog Video experience, tt restores the experiment results in vidiot very well.
2. The keyborad input is amazing. It is so convenient for users to try different combinations of oscillators and effects.
3. It does remind John of retro visual effects on the CRT display.
4. But it only has horizontal modulation, it would be better to add some vertical modulations, or try to mimic the diamond input on vidiot, which might combine to create more unexpected effects.
